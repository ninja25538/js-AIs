# js-genetic-algo
A visual work in progress genetic algorithm for eating a plant. I neeed help with this as it's being a royal pain and I can't seem to figure out why. Some lovely problems include (but are not limited to):

On the 2nd generation, just completely stops working
On generation 1, doesn't go to the same place it got to on generation 0

Help plz =(

Here's how it's supposed to work:

1. 2 Random AI are born
2. Whichever reaches the plant in the fewest amount of moves "wins" and keeps its memory of all the moves it has made, the other AI has its memory wiped
3. 1 random AI is generated and the AI that had won the last "contest" follows the same path it did last time.
Go to step 2.
